Markets on Kalshi follow a lifecycle from creation through trading to determination and settlement. This page describes the states a market passes through and what to expect at each stage.

Statuses

The REST API returns these statuses on `GET /markets` and `GET /markets/{ticker}`:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `initialized` | Created but not yet open for trading. Transitions to `active` when `open_time` passes. |
| `active` | Open for trading. |
| `inactive` | Temporarily deactivated by the exchange. Trading is paused but the market has not closed. |
| `closed` | Past `close_time`. No new orders accepted. Awaiting determination. |
| `determined` | Result is known. Settlement timer is running. |
| `disputed` | Result has been challenged. May be re-determined. |
| `amended` | Re-determined after a dispute. Settlement timer restarts. |
| `finalized` | Settlement complete. Positions have been paid out. Terminal state. |

When filtering with `GET /markets?status=`, the values map as follows:

| Filter value | Matches |
| --- | --- |
| `unopened` | `initialized` (before `open_time`) |
| `open` | `active` |
| `paused` | `inactive` |
| `closed` | Any market past `close_time` that is not yet `finalized` |
| `settled` | `finalized` |

Transitions

Some transitions are implicit (time-based), others are explicit (event-driven). **Implicit (no WebSocket event):**

-   `initialized` → `active`: when `open_time` passes. There is no `activated` WebSocket event for this transition.
-   `active` / `inactive` → `closed`: when `close_time` passes.

**Explicit (WebSocket event emitted):**

-   `active` → `inactive`: exchange deactivates the market. Event: `deactivated`.
-   `inactive` → `active`: exchange reactivates a paused market. Event: `activated`. All resting orders are cancelled on this reactivation.
-   `closed` → reopened `active`: `close_time` is moved into the future. Events: `close_date_updated`, then `activated`.
-   Close time updated: `close_time` changes. Event: `close_date_updated`. This can happen when a market is closed ahead of its scheduled close time, including before determination.
-   `closed` → `determined`: result is set. Event: `determined`.
-   `determined` / `amended` → `finalized`: positions paid out. Event: `settled`.

Time fields

Markets have several time fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `open_time` | When the market opens for trading. |
| `close_time` | When trading stops. May be moved earlier if `can_close_early` is true. |
| `expected_expiration_time` | When the outcome is expected to be known. |
| `latest_expiration_time` | Latest possible expiration time. |
| `expiration_time` | Deprecated legacy field. Prefer `latest_expiration_time` for the legacy expiry semantics; use `expected_expiration_time` if you want the forecasted time. |

Determination and settlement

After a market closes and the outcome is known, the market is determined and `result` is set to `yes`, `no`, or `scalar`. A settlement timer then runs for `settlement_timer_seconds`, which is visible in the REST response. During this window the market remains at `determined` and the result may be disputed. Once settlement completes, positions are paid out. In REST, settled markets end up at `finalized` rather than a separate `settled` status, and `settlement_ts` is populated.

Orders after close

Once `close_time` passes, all order operations, including cancellations, are rejected with `MARKET_INACTIVE`. Resting orders are cancelled shortly after close, and cancellation updates are published on the usual user channels.

WebSocket

Market lifecycle events are delivered on two channels:

| Channel | Markets covered | Event types |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `market_lifecycle_v2` | All markets except MVE (`KXMVE*`) | `created`, `activated`, `deactivated`, `close_date_updated`, `determined`, `settled`, `metadata_updated` |
| `multivariate_market_lifecycle` | MVE markets only (`KXMVE*`) | `created`, `activated`, `deactivated`, `close_date_updated`, `determined`, `settled` |

Both channels also emit `event_lifecycle` messages when new events are created. The `market_lifecycle_v2` channel additionally emits `event_fee_update` messages when an event-level fee override is set or cleared. The WebSocket `settled` event corresponds to settlement being processed; in REST, settled markets end up at `finalized`.

FAQ

Why can \`expected\_expiration\_time\` be before \`close\_time\`?

`expected_expiration_time` is the time the event is likely to resolve (for a sports game, typically a few hours after the scheduled start). `close_time` is when the market automatically closes for trading, and may be set well into the future to allow for rescheduling. That means `expected_expiration_time` can be earlier than `close_time`.

Why might \`GET /markets/{ticker}\` return \`404\` right after a \`created\` event?

The market may not be queryable immediately after a `created` event. Retry with backoff.

Do event responses include a top-level \`status\` field?

`GET /events` supports a `status` filter with values `unopened`, `open`, `closed`, and `settled`. The filter matches on child market statuses, not an event-level status; an event appears in results if **any** of its child markets has a matching status. For example, an event with four open markets and one settled market matches both `status=open` and `status=settled`. Use `with_nested_markets=true` if you need individual market statuses.
